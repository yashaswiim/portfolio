            This project was developed as part of the video assignment for
            Communications Lab class, where we were given four different
            prompts. One of them was to create a 3 part video series that
            teaches us "How To..." do something. We initially wanted to follow
            this prompt but later came up with an idea to use this as the base
            idea and mix it with the first prompt, which was to tell a story
            about a specific location and the characters who visit or live
            there. Our initial idea was to create a how to do your skincare
            routine video series with an unexpected twist. We later realized
            that this idea fits the first prompt better where we present our
            idea as a story about the haunted residence of an influencer, who is
            trying to make a video about her skincare and makeup routine. We
            then convey the horror experience that our protagonist, who lives in
            the haunted residence, encounters as she is shooting her "How to do
            your skincare/makeup" video. We decided to present the video as a
            special live video on the Vogue website as our idea matched well
            with the kind of videos Vogue website hosts.
